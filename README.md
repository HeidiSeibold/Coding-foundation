## What is coding foundation?
Coding foundation is an open source initiative aiming to increase the numbers of women and queer individuals in undergraduate courses related to computer science and associated tech areas.

We aim to do this by creating a supportive, welcoming, and empowering community of individuals sharing common interests regardless of their cultural, educational, and ethnic background.
